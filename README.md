# Freddy's Hall

Welcome to PDS's first proper attempt at a FNaF Fangame!
### **PUBLIC LAUNCH DATE: 9/12/22**
Note: Launch date is subject to change, depending on external factors


## Get Started:
To get started, you need the following:
- Python 3.8
- A Windows 10 / 11 device (Windows 7 may work, this is untested)
- An internet connection (for setting up and installing Freddy's Hall)

When you run Freddy's Hall, or the installer, the following dependencies will be installed:
- Pygame
- Pygame Widgets
- Win32Com for Python

Minimum Specs:
CPU: intel CORE i5 8th gen w/ hyperthreading enabled, or better
GPU: 
RAM: 8 GB

## Install Freddy's Hall
Unfortunately, the process to install Freddy's Hall is a bit complicated. However, you should be fine if you follow these instructions!
1) Locate and download the installer program (installer.py) and your platform's binary ("fhall-<platform>.dat"), download them
2) Place the files in the same folder. Rename the binary file to "fhall.dat"
3) Run installer.py, follow the prompts. This may take a few minutes, depending on how many dependencies are missing

## Play Freddy's Hall
Once installed, Freddy's Hall should have automatically created a shortcut on your Desktop [see note 1]. Use this shortcut to launch Freddy's Hall
  
When the game launches, it will show a disclaimer and how to play, then send you to the main menu. Please be aware the main menu is a new, experimental feature and may not always work correctly.

1: The desktop shortcut will only be created if your desktop folder is at <win_drive>:/Users/<user>/Desktop and if you're on Windows. Linux doesn't have shortcut support yet.
