# Freddy's Hall

Welcome to PDS's first proper attempt at a FNaF Fangame!


## Get Started:
To get started, you need the following:
- Python 3.8
- A Windows 10 or 11 device (Windows 7 may work, this is untested)
- An internet connection (for setting up and installing Freddy's Hall)

## Install Freddy's Hall
Unfortunately, the process to install Freddy's Hall is a bit complicated. However, you should be fine if you follow these instructions!
1) Locate and download the installer program (installer.py) and your platform's binary ("fhall-<platform>.dat"), download them
2) Place the files in the same folder. Rename the binary file to "fhall.dat"
3) Run installer.py, follow the prompts. This may take a few minutes, depending on how many dependencies are missing
